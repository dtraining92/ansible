Ansible Error Handling Concepts:

Error handling is essential for ensuring tasks and playbooks can gracefully handle failures or unexpected results. Here are the primary methods and concepts for handling errors in Ansible:
1. ignore_errors:

Use ignore_errors: yes to allow a task to continue even if it fails. This can be helpful for non-critical tasks where failure doesn’t impact the overall workflow.

2. Failed_when:

The failed_when condition allows you to define custom failure criteria for a task. This is useful when a task might return a non-zero status that isn’t actually a failure.


3. rescue and always Blocks:


Ansible’s block structure supports rescue and always blocks, similar to try-except-finally in programming.

block: Defines a set of tasks to try.
rescue: Executes if any task in the block fails, letting you define alternative actions or recovery steps.
always: Executes regardless of success or failure, useful for cleanup or final notifications.


4. Event Logging for Troubleshooting:

   Use the debug module to log detailed information about task outcomes, variable states, or failure messages, which can be valuable for troubleshooting.




5. register and when:

Use register to capture the result of a task and then use when conditions to make decisions based on the success or failure of previous tasks.
